# pokemon-invaders-clock

A clock with a Pokemon image in the background, a large bee flying occasionally across the screen, and some space invaders that can be shot with an invisible cannon that is controlled with the mouse, which explode with some nice particles.

This is a crazy amalgamation of bits to play around with Lua and Love2D. The design was largely driven by my desire to impress my children. This was minimally successful.

## Getting Started

Install [ZeroBrane Studio](https://studio.zerobrane.com/) and [LÃ–VE 2D Game Engine](https://love2d.org/), then clone the repository someplace and set ZeroBrane's project directory to that place. You may need to tell ZeroBrane to use Love2D's interpreter (this can be selected from the top menu).

## Contributing

Please don't. This nonsense is cluttered enough.
